### Day 1: Mon March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** First time to create a project,find out how to download LaTeX source file from Arxiv

**Thoughts:** Thought I should download pdf file and extract what I want from pdf and then convert it to html. Now I know it's silly. I could use Django framework.
